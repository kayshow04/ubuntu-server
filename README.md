README.md description that outlines the steps to create an Ubuntu server, install Apache2, configure SSH and HTTP connections using Terraform, and manage the index.html file with backups and updates:

Setting Up Ubuntu Server with Apache2 Using Terraform
This repository demonstrates how to automate the provisioning of an Ubuntu server with Apache2 using Terraform. The setup includes configuring SSH and HTTP connections, creating a backup of index.html, and updating the HTML file.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed locally:

===> Terraform
===> Git

Steps to Deploy
Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machineCreate a Feature Branch:
Before starting any new work, create a new branch off master specifically for your feature
Work on Your Feature
Make your changes (add, modify, delete files) on the feature-branch
Push Your Feature Branch:
Periodically push your feature branch to the remote repository to collaborate with others or for backup purposes
Testing and Iteration
Test your changes thoroughly on the feature-branch. Iterate on your code as necessary, making additional commits as you progress.
Updating Your Branch
Regularly fetch and pull updates from the remote repositoryâ€™s master branch to keep your feature branch up to date with the latest changes
Then, merge your feature branch into master #optional
Configure Terraform
Initialize Terraform in the project directory
Create Ubuntu Server with Apache2
Apply Terraform configuration to create the server.
Accessing the Server
Once provisioned, Terraform will output the public IP address of the server. You can SSH into the server using
==> Backup index.html
A backup of the default index.html file will be created automatically during provisioning.
Update index.html
To update the content of index.html, modify the file locally and use SCP or SSH to transfer it to the server.
Notes
Ensure your AWS credentials are configured properly.
Customize index.html as per your project requirements.
Adjust security group settings (security_group.tf) for production use
==========================================================================
Benefits of This Approach
Isolation: Work on new features or fixes in isolation without affecting master.
Collaboration: Easily collaborate with team members by pushing and pulling branches.
Testing: Test changes thoroughly on the feature branch before merging into master.
Version Control: Maintain a clear history of changes with descriptive commit messages.
====================Tips===================================================
Commit Often: Make small, incremental commits with descriptive messages.
Review Changes: Use git diff to review your changes before committing.
Use Branch Names: Choose meaningful branch names (feature-branch, fix-branch) for clarity.
Rebase: Use git rebase to keep your branch up to date with master and maintain a cleaner history.
By following this Git workflow, you can effectively manage your code, collaborate with others, and ensure that changes are thoroughly tested before being merged into the main master branch
